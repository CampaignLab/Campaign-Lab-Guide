If you have done work at CampaignLab, *please* add a link in this spreadsheet, and document how far you got, and what the code does so far.

### Converted datasets

We are aiming to make transformers which convert data. Some converted datasets will be stored on GitHub but they can be big. There is a JSON dataset inventory so that we can eventually index our converted datasets.
https://github.com/morkeltry/GSScode-converter/blob/master/js-xlsx/inventory.js
will be cloned to
https://github.com/CampaignLab/data-pipeline/tree/master/js-xlsx/inventory.js
today.
