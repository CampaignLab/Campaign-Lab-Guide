# START HERE!

This document is a **list of the authoritative documents** with which we keep track of our progress.
 Please keep the documents linked to here maintained and don't duplicate their functionality elsewhere :)

### CampaignLab Guide
Your guide to how to interact with our multifarious projects!

### The data inventory
This is the spreadsheet which should store links to every dataset which might be interesting to us.

### Ongoing projects you can get involved in:

Non-exhaustive, but descriptive list of the fun stuff we're doing! This doc is for peeople to read who want to know what projects they could get involved in, or start :)

###  Don't duplicate work!  Has your project already been started?

Coding and transformer work is listed here:

https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1s6U4PTd8V2pKUdNIO1eR3y-Pl_P8zth-DLi0zyVwO9w/edit?usp=sharing

We are in the process of documenting this all. Until then, please check through to see if your work is mentioned, or if you are beginning a project, whether someone has already begun!

If you have done work at CampaignLab, *please* add a link in this spreadsheet, and document how far you got, and what the code does so far.

### Converted datasets

We are aiming to make transformers which convert data. Some converted datasets will be stored on GitHub but they can be big, so it's worth keeping them in a data floder which is .gitignore'd. There is a JSON dataset inventory so that we can eventually index our converted datasets in a form that our programs can read. This will also help for quickly or automatically downloading the files we didn't pull in the repo.
