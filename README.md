# START HERE!

This document is a list of the authoritative documents with which we keep track of our progress.
 Please keep the documents linked to here maintained and don't duplicate their functionality elsewhere :)

###  Don't duplicate work!  Has your project already been started?

Coding and transformer work is listed here:

https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1s6U4PTd8V2pKUdNIO1eR3y-Pl_P8zth-DLi0zyVwO9w/edit?usp=sharing

We are in the process of documenting this all. Until then, please check through to see if your work is mentioned, or if you are beginning a project, whether someone has already begun!

If you have done work at CampaignLab, *please* add a link in this spreadsheet, and document how far you got, and what the code does so far.

### Converted datasets

We are aiming to make transformers which convert data. Some converted datasets will be stored on GitHub but they can be big. There is a JSON dataset inventory so that we can eventually index our converted datasets.
https://github.com/morkeltry/GSScode-converter/blob/master/js-xlsx/inventory.js
will be cloned to
https://github.com/CampaignLab/data-pipeline/tree/master/js-xlsx/inventory.js
today.
